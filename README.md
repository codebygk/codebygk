# 👋 Hey, I'm Gopalakrishnan (@codebygk)

### Building the bridge between QA, Development, and AI

I craft tools that make software testing smarter, development faster, and AI more accessible. Because quality shouldn't be a bottleneck—it should be a catalyst.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in creating **practical, production-ready tools** at the intersection of:

- **Quality Assurance** – Automation frameworks, testing utilities, and CI/CD integrations
- **Development** – Developer tools, libraries, and productivity enhancers  
- **Artificial Intelligence** – AI-powered testing solutions, intelligent automation, and ML workflows

If it can be automated, optimized, or intelligently enhanced, I'm probably building it.

## 💡 Philosophy

```
Test smarter, not harder.
Code with purpose, build with passion.
Make AI work for you, not against you.
```

Quality assurance isn't just about finding bugs—it's about building systems that prevent them. Development isn't just about features—it's about creating maintainable, testable architectures. And AI isn't magic—it's a tool that, when wielded correctly, can transform how we build software.
